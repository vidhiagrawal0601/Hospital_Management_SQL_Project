🏥 Hospital Management Data Analysis using SQL

 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing hospital data using SQL** to extract meaningful business insights.  
The dataset contains details about hospitals, locations, departments, number of doctors, patient counts, admission/discharge dates, and medical expenses.  

Using SQL queries, the project answers critical business questions such as:  
- Which hospital treated the most patients?  
- What is the average number of doctors per hospital?  
- Which departments handle the highest and lowest patient loads?  
- Which hospital incurs the maximum medical expenses?  
- How long do patients stay on average in each department?  
- What are the monthly medical expense trends?  

The aim is to demonstrate how SQL can be applied to **healthcare analytics** for resource planning, cost control, and better decision-making.


🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL 17**  
- **pgAdmin 4**  
- Dataset: `Hospital_Data.csv`  



#📂 Project Structure
- `HOSPITAL DATASET SQL QUERIES.sql` → Contains all SQL queries used for analysis  
- `Hospital_Data.csv` → Sample dataset (hospital, patients, expenses, etc.)  
- `Screenshots/` → Query outputs and result snapshots  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  



📊 SQL Queries & Analysis
1. **Total number of patients per hospital**  
2. **Average number of doctors per hospital**  
3. **Top 3 departments with the highest patient counts**  
4. **Hospital with maximum medical expenses**  
5. **Longest hospital stay**  
6. **Total patients treated per city**  
7. **Average length of stay per department**  
8. **Department with the lowest patient count**  
9. **Monthly medical expenses trend**

 📈 Key Insights
- The **top 3 departments** handling the most patients are `Urology`, `Neurology`, and `ENT`.  
- The **highest medical expenses** were recorded at `[Healing touch]`.  
- The **department with the lowest patient count** is `[cardiology]`.  
- The **monthly trend** shows peak expenses in `[Month 11]`.  
- Patients in `[neurologyt]` had the **longest average hospital stay**.  




 🚀 Future Scope
Currently, this project is **SQL-only**. The next phase will include:  
- Building an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize insights (patients, doctors, expenses, and trends).  
- Adding **KPIs** like average stay duration, expense per patient, and city-wise patient flow.  
- Automating data pipeline for **real-time healthcare analytics**.
